intro: >-
  In many apps, you will see some suggestions listed right under the search bar
  as you type. To implement this feature in React Native, there is a library
  called
  “[react-native-google-places-autocomplete](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-google-places-autocomplete)”.
  However, it is not that difficult to implement a simple version of the same
  feature. If you can build your own search bar, you will have more flexibility
  in terms of styling and functionality. In this article, I will show you how to
  build your own search bar with autocomplete functionality.
