intro: >-
  At WWDC in 2015, the powerful concept called Protocol-Oriented
  Programming(POP) was introduced. In this article, I try to summarize the
  concepts from the video of WWDC. If you havenâ€™t watched the presentation, I
  strongly recommend that you watch[the
  video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/)at least once.
