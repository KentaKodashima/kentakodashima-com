about: >-
  The old version of my portfolio website. In order to manage the contents
  easily, I created the custom WordPress theme from scratch. Originally, I was
  using jQuery with CSS to implement animations. However, I re-wrote the JS part
  with pure Javascript to deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation with
  Javascript.
technologies:
  - WordPress (Custom Theme)
  - Pure Javascript
  - HTML/CSS
  - Sass
  - 'Linux (Ubuntu 18.4: DigitalOcean Droplet)'
