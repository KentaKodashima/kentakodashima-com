  This is the old version of my portfolio. In order to manage the contents
  easily, I created the custom WordPress theme from scratch. Originally, I was
  using jQuery with CSS3 to make animations. However, I rewrote the JS part with
  Vanilla JS just for fun.
technologies:
  - WordPress (Custom Theme)
  - Vanilla JS
  - HTML/CSS
  - Sass
  - 'Linux (Ubuntu 18.4: DigitalOcean Droplet)'
