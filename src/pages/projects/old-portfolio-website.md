  This is the old version of my portfolio website. In order to make it easy to
  manage contents, I built my own custom WordPress theme. Although I have never
  made a custom WP theme before, I managed to learn how to build it in a week.
  The items under the 'Works', 'Popular Articles on My Blog' and 'My Study
  Resources' sections can be added just like regular WP posts.
