  The LP for Nihonbashi Philly, a restaurant in Tokyo. I coded everything from
  scratch according to the design. The animations and effects are implemented
  with CSS and pure Javascript. For the sliders, I used Swiper.js, a library
  built without jQuery, so this website is jQuery-free.


  In order to fasten the development process and enhance the maintainability, I
  made the most of Sass features such as variables and mixin. Thanks to Sass, I
  was able to remove some code repeatitions and improve the code readability.
