  The website for Tokyo Sevens Rugby School. They were having critical issues
  with the previous version of their website and needed the new website as soon
  as possible.


  The main requirement was to have the functionality to post news and letters.
  In order to deliver the website as soon as possible, I decided to pick a free
  WordPress theme and add custom post types to it. Everything was done in a
  week.
technologies:
  - HTML / CSS
  - WordPress
  - PHP
