  This is the website for Tokyo Sevens Rugby School. They were having critical
  issues with the previous version of their website and needed the new website
  as soon as possible.


  The main requirement was to have functionality to post news and letters. In
  order to deliver the website as soon as possible, I decided to add custom post
  types based on an existing WordPress theme. Everything was done in a week.
technologies:
  - HTML / CSS
  - WordPress
  - PHP
