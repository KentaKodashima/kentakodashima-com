about: >-
  This is a showcase of my works and skills. During the process of developing my
  portfolio, I have tried out some new technologies such as Gatsby.js, Netlify
  CMS and Styled Components.


  My old portfolio was built using my own custom WordPress theme to manage
  contents easily. Although my old portfolio's performance was good, the
  performance has been extremely improved enough to score 100% on PageSpeed
  Insights by Google after switching the website to Gatsby.
