about: >-
  Yumii Rewards is the cross platform mobile app that allows the bubble tea /
  coffee shops in town to offer a variety of promotions through the app. Using
  Yumii Rewards, users can collect stamps to redeem rewards at their favorite
  stores.


  In this project, I was in charge of developing the Node/Express authentication
  server, GraphQL server and the customer-side UI of the React Native app. I
  have also automated the builds using App Center and CodePush from Microsoft.
