about: >-
  Barter Aye is an online trading platform where users can buy, sell and trade
  items that they no longer use for free. The app consists of the
  Node.js/Express.js authentication server, the GraphQL contents server and the
  React Native app itself. The servers are hosted on AWS.


  My responsibility is to maintain the app including the backend and add new
  features. The trickiest task related to this app was to change the domain name
  through out the app.
