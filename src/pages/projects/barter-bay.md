about: >-
  Barter Bay is an online trading platform where users can buy, sell and trade
  items that they no longer use for free. The app consists of the Node/Express
  authentication server, the GraphQL contents server and the app itself.


  My responsibility is to maintain the app and add new features. So far, I was
  in charge of fixing some bugs and adding the daily reward feature.
